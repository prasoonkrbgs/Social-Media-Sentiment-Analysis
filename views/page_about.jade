      h1 About Sentiment Sweep

      h2 Introduction
      .row.card-panel
         h3 What is Sentiment Sweep?
         p.flow-text
            | Sentiment Sweep aims to captcha the mood of the internet,
            | either overall or towards a specific topic.
            | It does this by analysing real-time Twitter data, and
            | calculating how positive or negative each Tweet it.
         p.flow-text
            | Ten dynamic data visualisations are then used to illustrate
            | the results, and find trends between sentiment and other factors
            | such as time of day, location, topic, country, people etc

         h3 What can it be used for?
         p.flow-text
            | SS has many uses, from analysing how successful a marketing
            | campaign was in various locations and times, and comparing it
            | to your competitors, to predicting how stock prices will change
            | based on what people are saying about that company. It can also
            | be used to predict which political party will be next in power
            | before the polls are in, based on popularity of each.
            | It can show which train lines are currently delayed or overcrowded,
            | or which the football team has the most support at that time,
            | to name just a few uses.
         h3 Is it free?
         p.flow-text Yes.

      h2 Technical Overview
      .row.card-panel
         h3 How does it work?
         p.flow-text Well, in short Tweets are streamed live from Twitter, and
            | as each one comes in an algorithm calculates the sentiment based on
            | which words are in the Tweet and how they are positioned.
            | A function is then triggered that formats that Tweet and adds it
            | to which ever data visualisations are currently being viewed.
            | If you search for a custom search term, then that will fetch fresh
            | data from Twitter relative to what you searched and the synonyms.
            | If it's for a location based visualisation that the Google Places API
            | is used in conjunction to get the latitude and longitude of where the
            | Tweet was from. Data from the last 60 minutes is cashed, so that
            | everything loads fast.
         p.flow-text All the data visualisations use the same backend, but have
            | different adapter code to format the data into the right format for
            | each chart, most of which is done server-side for efficiency.
            | Everything's written in a very modular way, for maximum code reusability.

         h3 Modular code, what's that?
         p.flow-text
            | Well most the components of sentiment sweep are quite generic, so
            | could be used for other things in other programs. For this reason
            | eight node modules have been written, documented and tested then
            | published free under the MIT license on NPM. They are in separate
            | repositories, but you can find links to them in the readme.md

         h3 So what's it written in?
         p.flow-text The backend is mainly Node.js written in CoffeeScript, and
            | using MongoDB for data caching. The data visualisations are mainly
            | developed using D3.js and most of them are rendered isomophically
            | so that real-time changes are efficient, again these are written in
            | CoffeeScript. The Express framework is used for routing, and page
            | layouts are written in Jade, with styles written in LESS.

         h3 Nice, so can I see the code?
         p.flow-text Yes, because it's 100% open sauce! Everything is published on
            | GitHub under the MIT license, so you can view and copy whatever
            | you want :)
            a(href='https://github.com/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation')
               |  Check it out here

         h3 How will I know what's what in the code?
         p.flow-text There is a lot of code, but it's all fully documented both
            | in-code documentation, unit tests, and written documentation.
            a(href='https://github.com/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation/tree/dev/docs')
               | You can read the written documentation here


      h2 Stability
      .row.card-panel
         h3 How do you know this works?
         p.flow-text It's unit tested.

         h3 What if I find a bug?
         p.flow-text If you find something that doesn't work as you'd expect,
            | then you can raise it as an issue
            a(href='https://github.com/Lissy93/twitter-sentiment-visualisation/issues')
               |  here.
         h3 The live data has stopped working, why?
         p.flow-text Probably the API limits have been reached, try again tomorrow.
            | This will be sorted later on when we can qualify for a larger quota.

         h3 What if I think this could be better?
         p.flow-text I'm always open to suggestions, there are contact details at the bottom of the page.
            | Or create a pull request on GitHub and implement your modifications for review.

      h2 Legal
      .row.card-panel
         h3 So I can copy the code, right?
         p.flow-text Yeah, because it's open-source. But you can't duplicate this
            | project and pass it of as your own work.

         h3 Is it guaranteed to work?
         p.flow-text Nope, no guarantees, use at your own risk.

         h3 Is it okay to be using people's Tweets like this?
         p.flow-text Sentiment Sweep follows the rules outlined in
            | the Twitter API T&C's. Only public Tweets are displayed,
            | and the users location is blurred by 100m, to hide their exact address.
            | No Tweets are cashed for more than 24 hours (usually it's less than an hour)
